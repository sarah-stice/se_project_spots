# Project 3: Spots

Spots is an image sharing social media website.

## Description

Spots is a multi-unit project implemented within the TripleTen curriculum. This project is a media-sharing app based on image and text media where users can input their own profiles and view other profiles. This current iteration is the first step in which the website was designed and made to be responsive, so it can be seamlessly functional for desktop as well as tablet and mobile users. As the project develops in further iterations, more information will be added to this description.
